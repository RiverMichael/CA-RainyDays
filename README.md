# CA HTML/CSS - RainyDays

This is my course assignment for the course in HTML/CSS at Noroff.

## Description

The assignment was to build a responsive website using html and css based on the prototype we made in the course Design1.

### Changes made from prototype to finished website

- On the homepage I decided to put the categories and bestseller images in a coloumn instead of in a row on smaller screen sizes. This was done to be able to have bigger images and make it more user firendly.

- I added a "card effect" to the items in the bestseller categorie on the homepage, and also as a hover effect to the products on the product page.

- On the product specific page I chose to take away the zoom-in icon next to the product image and replace it with thumbnails below the main picture instead.

- I decided to change the colors on the checkout-card to make it look more like a card popping up.

- I added a footer on all screen sizes instead of only on the mobile version as was suggested on my feedback in the design course.
