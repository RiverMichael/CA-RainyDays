# RainyDays

This is my course assignment for the course in HTML/CSS at Noroff.

## Description

The assignment was to build a responsive website using html and css based on the prototype we made in the course Design1.

## Changes made from prototype to finished website

### Changes made while construction the site in HTML/CSS based on the prototype

- On the homepage I decided to put the categories and bestseller images in a column instead of a row on smaller screen sizes. This was done to be able to have bigger images and make it more user friendly.

- I added a "card effect" to the items in the bestseller categories on the homepage, and also as a hover effect to the products on the product page.

- On the product specific page I chose to take away the zoom-in icon next to the product image and replace it with thumbnails below the main picture instead.

- I decided to change the colors on the checkout-card to make it look more like a card popping up.

- I added a footer on all screen sizes instead of only on the mobile version, as was suggested in the feedback from the design course.

### Changes made when applying JS and changes based on the course in IxD

- To make the site more "clean" as an e-commerce site normally is I:

  - Removed the background color on the header/footer.
  - Removed the background image on the shopping cart page, changed the background color of the shopping cart and checkout form.

- Changed the homepage intro image to fit the site better.

- Changed the menu:hover effect, and the hover effect on the products on the product page.

- Changed the name shopping bag to shopping cart, and made som overall CSS changes on that page.

- Made a local JS file containing the different products in an array of objects.

- Created a product specific description page rendering the different products from the local array.

- Made the shopping cart functional with JS using local storage.

- Made the hamburger menu work with JS instead of the checkbox hack.

- Implemented JS validation on all form inputs instead of HTML required.
